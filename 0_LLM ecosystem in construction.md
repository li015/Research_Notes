`Brief History of Construction Industry`
The construction industry, traditionally characterized by manual labor and time-intensive processes, stands on the brink of a revolutionary shift driven by automation. Historically, this sector has been slow to adopt new technologies compared to other industries, largely due to its complex, project-based nature, and the unique challenges posed by each construction site. `Introduction to Automation`However, the advent of automation technologies has ushered in a new era, promising to redefine the landscape of construction through enhanced efficiency, safety, and cost-effectiveness. From the rudimentary machinery of the past to today's sophisticated drones and 3D printing technologies, the journey of automation in construction mirrors the broader technological advancements in engineering and computing.`Impact of Automation on Construction`A~~s we delve into the impact of automation, it becomes evident that these innovations not only streamline operations but also address longstanding industry challenges, paving the way for a future where construction projects are faster, safer, and more environmentally sustainable (de Wardt et al., 2022; Buchanan & Gardner, 2019).~~
The impact of automation on the construction industry is multifaceted. Breen (1987) and Akinradewo (2021) both highlight the positive effects, such as improved productivity, reduced costs, and enhanced safety. However, Oke (2017) and Kamaruddin (2016) caution that there are potential negative impacts, including the need for managing and minimizing these effects, and the potential for decreased quality and productivity. Overall, while automation has the potential to significantly improve the construction industry, it is important to carefully consider and manage its implementation.

The adoption of automation technology in construction is hindered by a range of barriers, including cultural, team, and technical aspects (Trujillo, 2020). Process-related factors also play a significant role in the adoption of automated data collection technology (Sardroud, 2014). Resistance to the introduction of automation and robotics is a key issue, with the conservative nature of the construction industry contributing to this resistance (Navon, 1992). These barriers highlight the need for industry-wide efforts to facilitate the adoption of automation technology in construction

1. To address these challenges, a Construction Robotics Excellence Model has been proposed, which provides a framework for overcoming these barriers and promoting the implementation of robotics systems in the construction industry (Jäkela, 2022).

One common factor is that they have all been determined for specifically defined tasks under construction site conditions and moreover designed to prevent the building site workers’ activities from being disturbed. Experience has shown that under these premises only a few robots can be applied economically.

The design and build procurement offering advantages like reduced lead times and improved communication, but faces challenges such as reduced design quality, which a new process model aims to address by [[integrating project participants into a multi-functional matrix team]] and using design function deployment for better client requirement abstraction.

This research sheds light on the [[complex relationship between industry structure, innovation, and supply chain integration, offering insights into how to promote energy-efficient innovations in the construction sector]].

This paper compares the performance of Design-Build (DB) and Design-Bid-Build (DBB) project delivery systems across 11 areas, utilizing data from 87 building projects. It develops [[statistical models to predict project outcomes, identifying the gross floor area as a critical factor for project speed]]. For DBB, contractors' design capabilities and equipment adequacy are pivotal, while for DB, contract period flexibility can affect speed. It also highlights the importance of a DB contractor's track record, financial management, and safety practices in predicting project quality and turnover.

In order [[to realize the benefits from making use of construction automation]] and to overcome the challenges to do so, the suggestions proposed are 1) Reengineer business structures and processes, 2) Increase the scale of adoption, 3) Assess project performance, 4) Develop building information protocols, 5) Develop appropriate legal contracts, and 6) Integrate building information through standard data schema.

`Future Prospects`
A competitive, market oriented and rationalized construction tomorrow requires [[developing of automated and robotized construction system]] today

The goal of an automated construction will be achieved, if following parameters will be met simultaneously without excluding each other: 
- Freedom in esthetic and design 
- Determination of the production costs before the execution of work 
- Determination of the production time before the execution of work 
- Guaranty and transparency of the price 
- Continuos production
- Definition of quality 
- Control and transparency of the quality
 ==Structualize them?==


Robot systems should take over the task of handling heavy loads, of performing dirty or dangerous work or of working at hardly accessible locations and in unfavourable physical positions. [[Above all robots should function as tools of the human being]] They are to be developped as intelligent tools and must not force the human being to the limits of working activities.

Changes in the labour environment and labour organisation by the application of robot systems must be primarily oriented to the working people in the first step and then in the second to technology.

project management enabling the application of [[construction robots]]

That requires an interlinking of the data and information flow from the draft to design, manufacture, assembly and facility management. The interlinking in the prefabrication of partial systems and their integration into the building processes plays a decisive role hereby

Information integration during the construction proces

The only purpose is to create an internal production plan, whereas many informations can be used as easy and as fast as possible.

Disruptors are pushing for non-traditional forms of contracting and [[a new value-driven business model based on a System of Systems architecture]].  

one of dominant themes within the Construction 4.0 is [[Automation and Decision Support for Prefabricated Construction]]

Project Management. I4.0 helps address the issue of stakeholders being fragmented in construction projects, which in turn hinders the accountable information sharing in construction project management. For example, Lee et al. (2021) proposed the possibility of integrating digital twin and blockchain framework for traceable data communication in construction projects to overcome this issue.



[[Data Intergration]] representing integration of data across various company departments and organisational hierarchy  (vertical integration) and supply chains (horizontal integration)
[[Data Silos]] in construction industry can be identified from several situation such as duplicate work (back-office work), bad customer experience

[[conventional construction and robotic technologies will coexist]], leading to a higher job variability and new roles, both at the managerial and operations/execution levels.

I hope that the adoption of social robots can enhance the concern in automation oriented construction systems. Together with a slightly modified design, the effective pre-fabrication and automated assembly on-site are processes, which can be linked together through a sophisticated computer integration and interface management.


NLP is a broader field that encompasses various techniques and models for processing human language, while LLMs are a specific type of model within NLP that specializes in understanding and generating human-like text. LLMs have demonstrated the ability to handle almost any NLP task, but they require massive amounts of data and computational resources to train, and can be prone to generating inaccurate, unsafe, or biased content[2](https://www.kolena.com/blog/llm-vs-nlp-6-key-differences-and-using-them-together).

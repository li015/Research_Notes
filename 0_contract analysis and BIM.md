# Introduction
## Brief History of Construction Industry
The construction industry, traditionally characterized by manual labor and time-intensive processes, stands on the brink of a revolutionary shift driven by automation. Historically, this sector has been slow to adopt new technologies compared to other industries, largely due to its complex, project-based nature, and the unique challenges posed by each construction site. 
Because of its culture and the nature of its goods, the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) sector is notorious for its **slow acceptance of innovation** in comparison to other industries. (Gambatese & Hallowell, 2011)[REF]. 
The industry is information-intensive, and the effective completion of projects depends on a wide range of information from various stakeholders. (Chen & Kamara, 2005). [REF]
However, there is a deficiency in the integration, reuse, and effective management of information, all of which have a significant impact on the industry's efficiency and stakeholders' ability to collaborate.
Previous reports within the construction sector have underscored the necessity of enhancing the industry's modus operandi in order to enhance efficiency and attain cost-effectiveness. (Egan, 1998). [REF]

## Introduction to Automation
However, the advent of automation technologies has ushered in a new era, promising to redefine the landscape of construction through enhanced efficiency, safety, and cost-effectiveness. From the rudimentary machinery of the past to today's sophisticated drones and 3D printing technologies, the journey of automation in construction mirrors the broader technological advancements in engineering and computing.
Although the industry today accounts for roughly 13% of the global GDP, during the past 20 years, productivity growth has barely increased by 1% annually. (Ribeirinho et al., 2020).[REF]
Also, the industry is facing a myriad of challenges such as delays, health & safety, cost overrun, shortage of skilled personnel, and stringent requirements by governments. 
With the advancement in information technologies and digital tools, the AEC industry has been embracing its usage to improve its performance in a bid towards the fourth industrial revolution (industry 4.0). [REF]

## Current State and Examples
Abioye et al. (2021) listed the subfield of AI to include machine learning, knowledge-based systems, computer vision, robotics, [[natural language processing]], automated planning and scheduling and optimization. These diverse fields have been employed in the AEC industry to improve productivity and efficiency. As such, AI has been leveraged in cost prediction, delay prediction, building design energy prediction, workers’ activity recognition, construction site safety, cash flow prediction, structural health monitoring, resource allocation and optimization, predictive maintenance, and decision support system, among others (Abioye et al., 2021). Studies have shown significant improvement in productivity and efficiency with the use of these tools;

## Current Challenge of C4.0 (*
however, bottlenecks have been reported. 
Challenges such as lack of **skilled workers, cultural resistance to change, cost of implementation, unavailability of structured data, trust and ethics** have been highlighted as the major hurdles towards the effective deployment of AI in the AEC industry (Akinosho et al., 2020).

## Conversational AI
Conversational AI deals with the application of NLP to enable computers to understand and interact with humans in a conversational way using natural language(Kulkarni et al., 2019). This improved human-computer interactions and led to the development of chatbots, virtual assistants and other conversational interfaces that can assists users in automating tasks, information retrieval, customer services among others. 
Saka et al. (2023) reviewed the current applications of Conversational AI in the AEC industry and highlighted that the deployment of this emerging field is still limited.
~~GPT models have beneficial applications in healthcare for triaging, analysing electronic health records, translation, medical education, medical and diagnostic (Li et al., 2023).~~ 
~~In bioinformatics, GPT model have been applied in sequence analysis, Genome analysis, Gene expression, proteomics, and in drug discovery (Zhang et al., 2023).~~ 
~~In education, GPT could transform autodidactic experience by providing personalized support, increased accessibility, flexible learning, real-time feedback and guidance (Firat, 2023).~~ Similarly, GPT can be leveraged in business and commerce for chatbots, virtual assistants, customer service management, sentiment analysis, financial analysis and forecasting, fraud detection and supply chain management (Zong & Krishnamachari, 2022).

## The importance of contract in forming construction automation
1. Construction contracts protect stakeholders' rights and interests, but failure to identify contractual risks may lead to disputes costing $52.6M on average and lasting 15.4 months. (ARCADIS, 2022)
2. Contract review involves identifying ambiguous clauses (Artan Ilter and Bakioglu, 2018), clarifying vague requirements (Hassan and Le, 2020, 2021; Hassan et al., 2020), and correcting inaccurate specifications (Hamie and Abdul-Malak, 2018).
3. Manual contract review is error-prone and time-consuming, relying heavily on experts' experience. (Lee et al., 2019; Moon et al., 2021)
4. Existing automated methods like rule-based NLP and machine learning have limitations in handling complex language and requiring extensive data. (Kim et al., 2020; Choi and Lee, 2022; Candaş and Tokdemir, 2022; Hassan and Le, 2021; Yang et al., 2022)
5. Language models can enhance semantic understanding of contracts. (Mohamed Hassan et al., 2022; Shuai, 2023; Fu et al., 2023)
6. Large language models (LLMs) show promise but face challenges like diluted domain data and imperfect representation learning when applied directly to specialized domains. (Ji et al., 2023; Mialon et al., 2023; Peng et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2023; Cui et al., 2023)
7. The proposed method augments LLMs with factual knowledge and expert knowledge to mitigate hallucination in construction contract risk identification (CCRI), without fine-tuning the LLM. (Gao et al., 2023; Guu et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2023)

[[@chenConstructionAutomationResearch2018]] identified three research clusters: [[Construction Robots]] and Automation Systems, Construction Managerial Objectives, Building Information Modelling Based Collaborations. I suggest that there is a need in apllications to combine these three objectives.

Construction projects make a challenging diffusion context for networked technology such as BIM [22](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016636151530021X?via%3Dihub#bib0285), for several reasons: construction firms exist along a spectrum ranging from highly computer literate ‘diffusion ready’ organizations to those hardly using computers in their work [23](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016636151530021X?via%3Dihub#bib0290), [24](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016636151530021X?via%3Dihub#bib0295); AEC organizations struggle to develop new forms of organizing and to change their established ways of working [25](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016636151530021X?via%3Dihub#bib0300); AEC firms frequently fail to establish common infrastructures for BIM technology use within and between organizations [26](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016636151530021X?via%3Dihub#bib0305); and many construction executives remain skeptical about the business value offered by BIM technology [27](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016636151530021X?via%3Dihub#bib0310).

having to purchase systems useful to work faster and more efficient can lead to a contradicting situation for some of the designers:[[@merschbrockEffectiveDigitalCollaboration2015]]

> We get paid by the hour so if we buy software to save time it is the client that benefits from it. Because we have to use our money to buy the software and we get less money from the client. But the client will benefit from us using less time.[[@merschbrockEffectiveDigitalCollaboration2015]]


On the downside, increasing clarity in design increased the accountability for the designers, which may be unwanted where the design is still under development[[@merschbrockEffectiveDigitalCollaboration2015]]

_Super users –_ highly capable and BIM-experienced designers were identified and formally appointed as ‘BIM super users’ for their disciplinary design group. These super users were seen as a BIM task force to start up the project and provide training and help for less experienced designers. These persons had a double role of troubleshooting practical BIM problems and training their peers in BIM use, in addition to working in their usual roles as project engineers or architects. [[@merschbrockEffectiveDigitalCollaboration2015]]

 the design team created a holistic approach to manage their collaborative design by establishing formal arrangements (contracts), a coherent way to produce models (BIM manual), a model exchange process, and defining roles and responsibilities for their collaboration. Former research has suggested that establishing an overall ‘organizing vision’ is essential for the functionality of inter-organizational systems [10](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016636151530021X?via%3Dihub#bib0225), [35](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016636151530021X?via%3Dihub#bib0350),[[@merschbrockEffectiveDigitalCollaboration2015]]

game theory:
	The limitations of game theory analysis methods include:
		 simplifying assumptions, rationality assumptions, information limitations, game complexity, and the need for players to know each other's cost functions. Game theory often relies on highly simplified models of real-world situations, assuming rational behavior from all players and complete information accessibility, which may not hold true in practice, leading to inaccurate predictions. Additionally, game theory is best suited for analyzing situations with a limited number of players and simple structures, facing challenges in more complex games. Moreover, **a fundamental limitation is that each player must know the cost functions of the other players**, which can be difficult to determine in practical settings, especially when dealing with uncertainties and the need for Bayesian analysis to reason about costs based on **observations of actions chosen by players**
	Proposed methods to address the limitations of game theory analysis include:
		1. **Modeling Uncertainty**: Introducing uncertainty into cost functions through Bayesian analysis can help reason about costs based on observed actions, mitigating the challenge of players needing to know each other's cost functions[2](https://lavalle.pl/planning/node475.html)
		2. **Repeated Games and Strategies**: Implementing strategies like Tit-for-Tat in repeated games can foster cooperation and better outcomes, even without direct communication between players, addressing issues of regret and multiple equilibria[2](https://lavalle.pl/planning/node475.html).
		3. **Evolutionary Game Theory**: Utilizing evolutionary game theory relaxes the assumption of player rationality, allowing for the exploration of strategies beyond traditional rational choices, which can be beneficial in scenarios where players may not be fully aware of the game dynamics[4](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/11/6/1353).
		4. **Cooperative Game Theory**: Transitioning to cooperative game theory can enable players to work together to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes, fostering collaboration and the formation of coalitions to reach shared goals[4](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/11/6/1353).

1. Data acquisition is indeed difficult, especially for sensitive corporate contract data that companies may be reluctant to share due to confidentiality concerns. This scarcity of data can severely limit the performance of ML/DL models that require large amounts of annotated examples to learn from.
2. However, recent advances in areas like transfer learning, few-shot learning, and unsupervised pretraining could help mitigate the data scarcity issue to some extent. Models pretrained on large generic corpora can then be fine-tuned on relatively small domain-specific datasets.
3. Data augmentation techniques like back-translation, contextual word replacements etc. may also be explored to synthetically increase the available training data for construction contracts.
4. Incentivizing data sharing among organizations by establishing secure data sharing frameworks and protocols could improve access to valuable contract data while preserving confidentiality.
5. Active learning methods that identify informative examples to be manually labeled by experts could also enable more efficient data annotation with lower human effort.
6. Going beyond justtext data, multimodal learning by combining contract text with associated drawings, specification documents etc. could improve context understanding.
7. Incorporating domain knowledge from construction experts through approaches like [[prompt engineering]] or neuro-symbolic reasoning may compensate for lack of data to some extent.

## Augment LLMs
1. Large language models (LLMs) like GPT and LLaMa have made significant progress and demonstrated emergent abilities like in-context learning, reasoning, and instruction following. GPT-4 outperforms existing models with up to 96.3% accuracy. (Brown et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2023; OpenAI, 2023)
2. LLMs have limitations leading to hallucination - generating incorrect, misleading or fabricated information, categorized as intrinsic and extrinsic hallucination. (Martino et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2023; Liang et al., 2023)
3. Fine-tuning LLMs on domain data can mitigate hallucination, as seen in legal domain applications like Lawyer LLaMA and ChatLaw. (Huang et al., 2023; Thoppilan et al., 2022; Tinn et al., 2023; Cui et al., 2023)
4. [[Prompt engineering]] guides LLMs to recall encapsulated knowledge and tackle reasoning through methods like Chain-of-Thought and Tree-of-Thoughts. (Wang et al., 2023; Shin et al., 2020; Sorensen et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2023)
5. Data/knowledge augmentation incorporates external knowledge sources like knowledge graphs into LLMs during pre-training or reasoning stages. (Liu et al., 2021; Yu et al., 2022; Sen et al., 2023; Hu et al., 2022)
6. Vector embeddings offer efficient semantic search and knowledge representation, outperforming knowledge graphs. (Minaee et al., 2021; Lazaridou et al., 2022; Nye et al., 2021)
7. Studies have used vector embeddings to retrieve relevant knowledge from sources like Wikipedia to improve LLM performance on reasoning tasks. (Peng et al., 2023; He et al., 2022)
8. The proposed method uses vector embeddings for efficient semantic retrieval of relevant knowledge to augment LLMs for identifying risks in contract clauses, aligning with human experts. (No explicit reference)
## LLM in contract analysis

use llm to explore the needs of stakeholders and find possible fault in contract

A range of studies have explored the use of large language models in contract analysis. Nawar (2022) developed an open-source application using machine learning and NLP to make legal contracts more comprehensible, achieving high performance on the Contract Understanding Atticus Dataset. Yang (2013) created a semantic search platform for analyzing complex contractual service agreements, which can identify specific legal concepts and organize key content. Bartoletti (2013) discussed the relevance of contracts in concurrent and distributed systems, emphasizing the need for reliable contract models. Owe (2009) introduced CO Diagrams, a visual model for specifying e-contracts, and defined a formal semantics for their analysis and verification. These studies collectively highlight the potential of large language models in improving contract analysis and understanding.

## contract analysis on BIM EIR
A range of studies have highlighted the importance of [[clear and comprehensive contract provisions in BIM contracts]]. Fan (2019) and Nilchian (2022) both emphasiz the need for clarity in roles, responsibilities, and data security, with Nilchian (2022) further identifying the importance of BIM ownership and copyright. Pérez-García (2021) and Manderson (2015) focus on the [[specific requirements and changes needed in BIM contracts]], with Pérez-García (2021) providing a detailed analysis of BIM requirements in Spanish public tenders and Manderson (2015) suggesting [[changes to facilitate BIM implementation in a collaborative environment]]. These studies collectively underscore the need for clear, comprehensive, and collaborative contract provisions in BIM contracts.


security of digital data usage and its integrity should be protected
restrictions should be imposed to reduce the loss of data and its privacy
[[data providers should be responsible for any data provided by them in the BIM ]]
the host of the model should be responsible to use, access, maintain, warrant, and retain the model for the agreed duration
roles and scope of works for parties involved
BIM and its quality checks in various stages of development
If it is true to be developed ahead of all the development stages, particularly before the construction stage?
[[BIM data should be included as part of the contract]]
the definition and the interrelationship among project participants involved in BIM
the parties who use or contribute to the BIM model, and who should also apply the standard of care when handling the model
different procurement strategies such as collaboration project delivery methods shall be distinguished from conventional procurement methods like design-bid-build and design-and-build when designing BIM contracts.


(1) an alternative project delivery approach that does not modify the original orientation of the design-bid-build procurement structure is required to deliver BIM effectively. 
(2) The potential change in the standard of care for project participants due to additional roles required in delivering BIM needs further investigation.
(3) The roles for auditing a BIM delivery system must be included in the contracts to ensure the quality and compliance of BIM deliverables.

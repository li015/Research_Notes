The motion of the body in ecological contexts is now commonly measured using inertial measurement units (IMUs). Raw IMU measurements can be processed through sensor-fusion algorithms and kinematic models of the body to estimate a wide variety of movement parameters in a variety of ways. Advancements continue to be made in estimating and using joint kinematics [11e16], foot movement [17e19], center of mass mechanics [20,21] and other aspects of movement.

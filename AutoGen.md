##### [notes ::   
We will demonstrate the basic application of Autogen through a test agent provided by the framework, twoagent: a helper agent and a user agent to write and execute code, which will keep communicating with each other until the task is completed.

What type of agent is used depends on the setting of the human input mode, where the user agent either seeks feedback from the human user or returns automatic feedback based on the success or failure of the code execution and its corresponding output. Fully automatic mode means that the program is fully autonomous and semi-automatic mode means that it seeks human feedback in order to complete the task.

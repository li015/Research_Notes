##### [notes :: 
Typically, a prompt will consist of two or more components, the most common of which include:

- **Instructions** tell the model what to do, how to behave, and how to structure outputs.
- **External information (source knowledge)** provides an additional option for information input into the model from external sources — we will discuss this more in the next section.
- **One/few-shot prompting** allows us to do _in-context_ learning by providing examples to our LLM.
- **User input** or _query_ is where we place a human user's input into the prompt.
- **Output indicator** marks the beginning of the to-be-generated text. Knowing how our outputs should begin can help guide the model by placing that preset text here.

[notes::
1.  The paper examines the potential of Integrated Human-Machine Intelligence (IHMI) in civil engineering, which can improve decision-making during civil engineering projects and emergencies.
2.  The paper identifies four knowledge gaps in achieving effective IHMI in civil engineering, including 
	>1. [[ defining tasks that can be assisted by AI]], 
	>2. [[Formalizing the interface between human and AI]], 
	>3. [[classifying barriers to data collection]],
	>4. and understanding the impacts of IHMI on the AEC industry and entrepreneurship.]

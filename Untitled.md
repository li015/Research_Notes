Supply Chain Structure:

- Two-level supply chain with one buyer (OEM/retailer) and one supplier (raw material supplier/OEM)
- Buyer faces stochastic demand with known mean and standard deviation

Objectives:

- Supplier and buyer aim to decide wholesale price/product price after analyzing costs
- Buyer wants to estimate optimal order quantity based on costs and prices
- Potential conflict between buyer's optimal decision and overall supply chain optimal

Coordination through Contracts:

- Different contracts (buyback, revenue sharing, quantity flexibility) are explored to align incentives
- Contracts allow estimating decision variables like order quantity before actual demand is known

Modeling Approach:

- Extension of the classical newsboy model to capture expectations of multiple parties
- Two phases:
    1. Decision support tool with analytical model and simulation
    2. Graph-theoretic model to quantify supply chain coordination
